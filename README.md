Source code for the Jumble Devs Spookie Boogie game.
Developed for the 2016 Global Game Jam at Gandia.

Spookie Boogie is a game in which you help the ghost 
of Sir Clockengurch, who was a saxofon player, to kick some teens out of 
his manor when they summon him from hell using a Ouija board. 

If you manage to scare the teens out of Sir Clockengurch home, you win.
Tap the furniture to interact with it and scare the teens, but take care,
they arent all scared equally by every object in game. Fill the Spook-O-Meter 
to win in classic mode, or play endless mode in Time Attack, where 
successful spooks give you more time and more points! Share your score 
by typing your name in the settings tab and playing Time attack to enter 
the Leaderboard.
